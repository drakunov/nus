Our robot will definitely find the gold if there is a totally safe path.
Our definition of totally safe path is:
-there will exist a path where you will definitely know you won't fall into a pit, without having to any risk
-if there is a wumpus obstructing the path, our robot is able to kill it.

Our robot is able to detect and kill the wumpus almost in all situation. 
It will fire an arrow with 4 beeping sound.It will not wait for any response, as our robot is definitely sure it will kill the wumpus the moment it fires the arrow.

Our robot will always move forward. Upon detecting a stench, it will try to detect the wumpus and then kill it. 
After killing it, it will then proceed as per normal. Upon failure to detect the position of the wumpus, it will treat it as a pit and take a step backward.
Our robot will always take a step back upon detecting a breeze or the boundaries. Then it will proceed to the right of the tile.
If the right tile is also an invalid or a risky move, then it will move to the left tile. If the left tile is also invalid or risky, it will then backtrack.

Upon detecting the gold, it will immediately grab the gold producing 3 beeping sequence up sound. Then it will backtrack its path to exit the wumpus world.
